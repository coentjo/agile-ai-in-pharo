#Learning Python

To really dive into AI at one point you will want to learn how to program.
The most-used programming language in the AI Field is Python. Online you can find a lot of courses and tutorials. One that I really like is given by Andrew Ng (a famous AI teacher!)
[Andrew Ng: python for beginners](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/ai-python-for-beginners/)
For this course an online coding environment is available, complete with a chatbot to ask questions about programming!
