#Different types of Neural Networks

Although the basic idea of a neural network is more or less the same, a lot of people have tried all kinds of variations:
We only looked at networks where the outputs of **all** perceptrons/neurons are connnected to the inputs of **all** perceptrons/neurons of the next layer. You can think of networks that do not connect all of these! Also you can think of an output that is leaded back into a previous layer or neuron.
As activation function we looked at the **Step** function and at the **Sigmoid**, but there are a lot more options.
For visual recognition also some additions were invented.
... maybe you have had some ideas/questions while looking and thinking about it: maybe investigate on it...?
