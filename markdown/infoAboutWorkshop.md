# Extra info about 'Intro Neural Networks Part 1'


+ No prior programming background required, although we will probably see some Objects like Neurons and NeuralNetworks sending messages to each other... but that's mainly to dive into how a neural network works. You will be surprised (well, I was) how simple the principles behind a Neuron are. (yes, a Network is more difficult, but )
	
+ We will also avoid mathematics, although some simple calculation will be unavoidable. 
	
+ No background in biology required, although that is the source of a lot of AI ideas. 
	
+ To get a glimpse you could take a short look at: https://github.com/coentjo/agile-ai-in-pharo (scroll down to the readme for some screenshots), but it is not necessary to join the session.
	
+ How can (in essence) a 'programmed system' get smarter without 're-programming'? How does 'learning' work? How does 'training' work? 
	
+ Bring on your laptop as well as your questions: I hope to make it interactive! (but also please help me in making it interesting for the whole group, as diverse as it is. 
	
+ I am not sure how far we will get in the first session, because I hope we will have some discussions on the fly. In the end, or afterward, we can decide which direction to go in the second session! 
	
+ We will be guided by Chepetto.
