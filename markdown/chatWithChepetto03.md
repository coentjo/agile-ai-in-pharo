> neural network: what values to put in at the beginning for bias and weights?

The values you choose for the initial biases and weights in a neural network can have a significant impact on the network's performance. There are several common approaches to initializing these values:

1.  Random Initialization: This is the most common method and involves randomly selecting values for the biases and weights. Typically, the values are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation of 1.
    
2.  Xavier Initialization: This method sets the initial weights such that the variance of the inputs is equal to the variance of the outputs. This is achieved by dividing the randomly initialized weights by the square root of the number of inputs to the neuron.
    
3.  He Initialization: This method is similar to Xavier Initialization, but it is used for networks that use activation functions like ReLU. The initial weights are scaled by a factor of sqrt(2/n), where n is the number of inputs to the neuron.
    
4.  Constant Initialization: In some cases, it may be desirable to set the biases or weights to a constant value. For example, if you know that a particular input is always positive, you may want to set the bias for that neuron to a positive constant.
    

The choice of initialization method depends on the specific architecture of your network and the problem you are trying to solve. In practice, it is often useful to experiment with different initialization methods to see which one works best for your application.

> what is the variance?

In statistics, variance is a measure of the spread or dispersion of a set of data points. It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean of the data set.

Mathematically, the variance of a set of n data points {x1, x2, ..., xn} with mean µ is given by:

Var(x) = (1/n) \* Σ(xi - µ)^2

where Σ denotes the sum from i = 1 to n.

The variance measures how much the data points are spread out from the mean. A high variance indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range, while a low variance indicates that the data points are clustered more tightly around the mean.

Variance is often used in combination with other statistical measures, such as standard deviation, to provide a more complete description of a set of data.

> dispersion?

In statistics, dispersion refers to how much the values in a dataset vary or spread out from each other. It is a measure of the degree of variability or diversity in a dataset. There are several ways to measure dispersion, including variance, standard deviation, range, and interquartile range.

Variance and standard deviation are measures of the spread of the data around the mean, while range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. Interquartile range is the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile of the dataset.

A dataset with low dispersion will have values that are relatively close together, while a dataset with high dispersion will have values that are more spread out. The choice of a specific measure of dispersion depends on the nature of the data and the research question at hand.

Dispersion is an important concept in statistics because it can impact the interpretation of statistical analyses. For example, if a dataset has high dispersion, it may be more difficult to identify patterns or relationships between variables. Conversely, if a dataset has low dispersion, patterns or relationships may be more easily identifiable.

> which activation function are there? Why?

There are several activation functions that are commonly used in artificial neural networks. The activation function is a non-linear function that is applied to the output of a neuron to introduce non-linearity into the network, which allows it to model more complex relationships between inputs and outputs. Here are some of the most commonly used activation functions:

1.  Sigmoid: The sigmoid function is defined as f(x) = 1/(1 + e^-x). It maps any input value to a value between 0 and 1, which can be interpreted as a probability. The sigmoid function is often used in the output layer of binary classification models.
    
2.  ReLU: The rectified linear unit (ReLU) function is defined as f(x) = max(0, x). It returns the input value if it is positive, and 0 otherwise. ReLU is a popular activation function in deep learning because it is computationally efficient and has been shown to be effective in many types of neural networks.
    
3.  Leaky ReLU: The leaky rectified linear unit (Leaky ReLU) function is similar to ReLU, but it allows a small positive gradient for negative input values. The function is defined as f(x) = max(ax, x), where a is a small constant such as 0.01.
    
4.  Tanh: The hyperbolic tangent (tanh) function is defined as f(x) = (e^x - e^-x)/(e^x + e^-x). It maps any input value to a value between -1 and 1, which can be useful for modeling data that has negative values.
    
5.  Softmax: The softmax function is often used in the output layer of multi-class classification models. It maps a vector of input values to a probability distribution over the output classes. The function is defined as f(x) = e^xi / Σ(e^xj), where xi is the input value for class i, and Σ(e^xj) is the sum of the exponential values of all input values.
    

There are many other activation functions that have been proposed, and the choice of function depends on the specific requirements of the problem being solved. Different activation functions have different properties and can impact the training and performance of a neural network.

> Where in a neural network can i find activation functions?

Activation functions are typically found in the hidden layers and the output layer of a neural network. The activation function is applied to the output of each neuron in the layer, transforming the input signal into an output signal that is passed to the next layer of the network.

In a typical neural network architecture, the input layer is where the input data is fed into the network. The input layer is followed by one or more hidden layers, which are responsible for transforming the input data into a representation that is more suitable for the task at hand. Each hidden layer typically has its own activation function, which introduces non-linearity into the network and allows it to model complex relationships between the input and output.

The output layer of the neural network is where the final prediction is made. The output layer may have a different activation function than the hidden layers, depending on the nature of the task being performed. For example, if the task is binary classification, the output layer may use a sigmoid activation function to produce a probability score between 0 and 1 for each class. If the task is multi-class classification, the output layer may use a softmax activation function to produce a probability distribution over the output classes.

The choice of activation function for each layer of the neural network depends on the specific requirements of the problem being solved and the properties of the activation function itself. Different activation functions can impact the performance and training of the network in different ways, so it is important to choose an appropriate activation function for each layer of the network.

> what kind of activation function should i use be default?

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the choice of activation function depends on the specific requirements of the problem being solved and the properties of the activation function itself. However, there are some general guidelines that can help guide the choice of activation function:

1.  ReLU is a good default choice for most problems. It is computationally efficient and has been shown to be effective in many types of neural networks.
    
2.  If the output of your network needs to be in a specific range (such as between 0 and 1), a sigmoid or softmax activation function may be more appropriate.
    
3.  If your network is prone to overfitting, using a regularization technique such as dropout may be more effective than changing the activation function.
    
4.  If your network is dealing with data that has negative values, using a tanh activation function may be more appropriate.
    
5.  If your network is deep (i.e., has many layers), using an activation function that helps alleviate the vanishing gradient problem (such as Leaky ReLU or ELU) may be more effective.
    

Ultimately, the choice of activation function should be based on empirical experimentation, where different activation functions are tried out and their performance on a validation set is compared. The best activation function for a given problem may depend on the specific properties of the data and the network architecture being used.
