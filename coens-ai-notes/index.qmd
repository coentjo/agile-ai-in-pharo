title: "Introduction"

Welcome! This is a Work-in-Progress, a collection of notes on AI 
I am collecting and which I use in my workshops about AI and GenAI. 
The newest version of this pdf may be found 
[here](https://github.com/coentjo/agile-ai-in-pharo/blob/master/coens-ai-notes/_output/Coen-s-AI-Notes.pdf)

It is not a complete or self-describing book, 
but when 
you attended one of my workshops you will probably find familiar 
stuff in one or more chapters. 

Our world is changing rapidly through AI and GenAI. One can ignore it or decide to not use it, 
but that does not stop it... One can also decide to dive in and help 'invent' the future, or 
at least learn about all the new stuff. 


These notes  started out as visualizations of Perceptrons and Neural 
Networks in the Glamorous Toolkit, which helped me give students insights 
in Neural Networks. 

I advice to get hands-on with the tools around.

When using online AI tools, please keep the privacy in mind when 
using personal data! One way to make sure private data will stay
private is using local AI's. 

Please also keep the Societal impact in mind! 
We can use AI to help us all, but there is of course also a huge dark side:  
When concentrating on efficiency only that could mean people getting fired, 
it also means it becomes easier to create fake news. 
Please use it wisely...
