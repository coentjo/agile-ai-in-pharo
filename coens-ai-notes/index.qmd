title: "Journey into Artificial Intelligence"

Welcome! This guide will always be a Work-in-Progress which can take you from the fundamental building blocks of AI onto 
neural networks.

## Learning Path


1. **AI Overview**.

2. **Perceptron Fundamentals**: The basic building block of neural networks - the Perceptron. 

3. **Neural Networks**: How will multiple Perceptrons combine to create neural networks capable of solving complex problems. 

4. **Possible next Steps**.


## Some background


1. It started out as visualizations of Perceptrons and Neural Networks in the Glamorous Toolkit, which helped me give students insights in Neural Networks. 
2. Get Hands-on: start using and trying out AI-tools you encounter.  
3. When using online AI tools, please keep the privacy in mind when using personal data!!
4. Please also keep the Societal impact in mind! We can use AI to help us all, but there is of course also a dark side! When concentrating on efficiency only that could mean (and often does!) people getting fired.
