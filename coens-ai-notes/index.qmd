title: "Journey into Artificial Intelligence"

Welcome! This is a Work-in-Progress, a collection of notes on AI I collected and use in my workshops. 

A newer version of this pdf may be found [here](https://github.com/coentjo/agile-ai-in-pharo/blob/master/coens-ai-notes/_output/Coen-s-AI-Notes.pdf)

## Learning Path


1. **AI Overview**.

2. **Perceptron Fundamentals**: The basic building block of neural networks - the Perceptron. 

3. **Neural Networks**: How will multiple Perceptrons combine to create neural networks capable of solving complex problems. 

4. **Possible next Steps**.


## Some background how I started


1. It started out as visualizations of Perceptrons and Neural Networks in the Glamorous Toolkit, which helped me give students insights in Neural Networks. 
2. Get Hands-on: start using and trying out AI-tools you encounter.  
3. When using online AI tools, please keep the privacy in mind when using personal data!!
4. Please also keep the Societal impact in mind! We can use AI to help us all, but there is of course also a dark side! When concentrating on efficiency only that could mean people getting fired.
