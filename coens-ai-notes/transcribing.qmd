Let's turn spoken words into text using AI! 🗣️➡️📝

We'll use a simple online tool called **[Otter.ai](https://otter.ai/)** 🦦.

### Your Mission (in 3 steps):

1.  **Sign Up:** Go to `Otter.ai` and create a free account. ✍️
2.  **Upload:** Find the "Import" button and upload your meeting audio file (`.mp3`, `.wav`, etc.). 📤
3.  **Transcribe:** Otter will work its magic! ✨ Then you can read, edit, and export your new transcript. 📄

**That's it!** You've just transcribed a meeting with AI. High five! 🙌🚀
