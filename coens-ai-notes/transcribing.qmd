---

Let's turn spoken words into text using AI! \emoji{speaking-head}\emoji{right-arrow}\emoji{pencil}

We'll use a simple online tool called **[Otter.ai](https://otter.ai/)** \emoji{otter}.

**Your Mission (in 3 steps):**

1.  **Sign Up:** Go to `Otter.ai` and create a free account. \emoji{writing-hand}
2.  **Upload:** Find the "Import" button and upload your meeting audio file (`.mp3`, `.wav`, etc.). \emoji{outbox-tray}
3.  **Transcribe:** Otter will work its magic! \emoji{sparkles} Then you can read, edit, and export your new transcript. \emoji{page-facing-up}

**That's it!** You've just transcribed a meeting with AI. High five! \emoji{raised-hands}\emoji{rocket}
