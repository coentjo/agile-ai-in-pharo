## Beyond Basic Training

While we've covered the fundamentals of neural network training, there are many advanced techniques that can significantly improve performance and efficiency.

## The Challenge of Overfitting

### Understanding Overfitting

Overfitting occurs when a model learns the training data too well:
- Memorizes training examples instead of learning patterns
- Performs poorly on new, unseen data
- Shows high training accuracy but low test accuracy

### Solutions to Overfitting

1. **Regularization**
   ```pharo
   "L2 Regularization example"
   regularizedError := error + (lambda * weights squared sum)
   ```

2. **Dropout**
   - Randomly deactivate neurons during training
   - Forces the network to be more robust
   - Typically 20-50% dropout rate

3. **Early Stopping**
   - Monitor validation performance
   - Stop when performance starts degrading
   - Save best performing model

## Data Augmentation

Increase training data variety:

```pharo
"Image augmentation example"
augmentedImage := originalImage
    rotate: (Random new nextFloat * 15);
    scale: (0.9 to: 1.1);
    addNoise: 0.05
```

Common augmentation techniques:
1. Rotation and scaling
2. Adding noise
3. Color adjustments
4. Random cropping

## Batch Processing

### Mini-batch Training

Benefits of batch processing:
- Faster convergence
- Better generalization
- More stable gradients

```pharo
"Mini-batch training example"
batchSize := 32.
batches := trainingData batchesOf: batchSize.
batches do: [:batch |
    gradients := self computeGradients: batch.
    self updateWeights: gradients
]
```

## Learning Rate Scheduling

Adaptive learning rates improve training:

1. **Step Decay**
   ```pharo
   "Step decay example"
   learningRate := initialRate * (decayFactor raisedTo: epochNumber // stepSize)
   ```

2. **Exponential Decay**
   ```pharo
   "Exponential decay"
   learningRate := initialRate * (decayBase raisedTo: epochNumber)
   ```

3. **Cosine Annealing**
   - Cyclical learning rates
   - Helps escape local minima
   - Enables better exploration

## Transfer Learning

Leverage pre-trained models:

1. Feature Extraction
   - Use pre-trained network as feature extractor
   - Add custom layers for your task
   - Freeze pre-trained weights

2. Fine-tuning
   ```pharo
   "Fine-tuning example"
   pretrainedNetwork
       freezeLayersUpTo: -2;
       addLayer: (Dense neurons: outputSize);
       trainOn: newData
   ```

## Monitoring and Visualization

Track training progress:

1. Loss Curves
   - Plot training and validation loss
   - Identify overfitting early
   - Guide hyperparameter tuning

2. Confusion Matrix
   ```pharo
   "Generate confusion matrix"
   confusionMatrix := predictions zip: actualLabels collect: [:pred :actual |
       (pred = actual) asBit
   ] groupedBy: #yourself
   ```

## Best Practices

1. Data Preparation
   - Normalize inputs
   - Handle missing values
   - Balance classes

2. Model Architecture
   - Start simple
   - Gradually add complexity
   - Use proven architectures

3. Training Process
   - Monitor key metrics
   - Save checkpoints
   - Use cross-validation

## Next Steps

Advanced techniques to explore:
1. Ensemble methods
2. Hyperparameter optimization
3. Advanced architectures
4. Custom loss functions

Remember: These techniques are tools in your toolkit. Choose them based on your specific problem and requirements.
