# If you prefer a story... 

The story that follows right here explains the ideas behind a Neural Network from a technical perspective. 
If you would rather read an Instructive Story, a Saga, 
read it online at: 
[Lonn's neural-net-saga](https://github.com/leonvanbokhorst/neural-net-saga). 
Scroll down a bit and start reading  'The Percy Chronicles: A Neural Network Saga'. 
At the end of that story you will find some python to get hands-on with.
