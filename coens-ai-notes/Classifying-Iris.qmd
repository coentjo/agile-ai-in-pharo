## A Real-World Machine Learning Challenge

The Iris flower classification problem is a classic example in machine learning. It involves predicting the species of an Iris flower based on measurements of its physical characteristics. This problem perfectly illustrates how neural networks can solve real-world classification tasks.

## The Dataset

The Iris dataset includes measurements of three different Iris species:
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolor
- Iris Virginica

For each flower, we have four measurements:
1. Sepal length
2. Sepal width
3. Petal length
4. Petal width

## Building the Neural Network

Let's create a network to classify Iris flowers:

```pharo
irisNetwork := NeuralNetwork new
    inputSize: 4;          "Four measurements"
    addHiddenLayer: 5;     "Hidden layer with 5 neurons"
    outputSize: 3;         "Three possible species"
    initialize.
```

## Preparing the Data

We need to format our data appropriately:

```pharo
"Example of one flower's data"
measurements := #(5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2).  "Setosa"
expectedOutput := #(1 0 0).          "One-hot encoding for Setosa"
```

## Training Process

```pharo
"Training with multiple examples"
trainingData do: [:example |
    measurements := example measurements.
    species := example species.
    irisNetwork trainOn: measurements expecting: species
].
```

## Making Predictions

After training, we can use the network to classify new flowers:

```pharo
newFlower := #(6.3 2.9 5.6 1.8).
prediction := irisNetwork predict: newFlower.
```

## Evaluating Performance

To assess our network's accuracy:

1. Split data into training and testing sets
2. Train on the training set
3. Evaluate on the testing set
4. Calculate accuracy metrics

## Key Learning Points

1. Neural networks can handle multi-class classification
2. Real-world data often needs preprocessing
3. We can measure success with accuracy metrics
4. The same principles apply to many similar problems

This practical example demonstrates how neural networks can solve real classification problems. In the next section, we'll explore the mathematics behind how these networks learn.
