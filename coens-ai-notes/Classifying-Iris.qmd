## A Real-World Machine Learning Challenge

The Iris flower classification problem is a classic example in machine learning. It involves predicting the species of an Iris flower based on measurements of its physical characteristics. This problem perfectly illustrates how neural networks can solve real-world classification tasks.

## The Dataset

The Iris dataset includes measurements of three different Iris species:
- Iris Setosa
- Iris Versicolor
- Iris Virginica

For each flower, we have four measurements:
1. Sepal length
2. Sepal width
3. Petal length
4. Petal width

Building a network that can do this is really outside of the scope of these notes, 
but a lot of info can be found on the internet on `Iris Classification`.

## Key Learning Points

1. Neural networks can handle multi-class classification
2. Real-world data often needs preprocessing
3. We can measure success with accuracy metrics
4. The same principles apply to many similar problems

This practical example demonstrates how neural networks can solve real classification problems. In the next section, we'll explore the mathematics behind how these networks learn.
