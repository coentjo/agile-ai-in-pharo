## The XOR Problem: A Classic Challenge

While Perceptrons are powerful tools for many classification tasks, they face a fundamental limitation: they can only solve linearly separable problems. The classic example of this limitation is the XOR (exclusive OR) function.

### What is XOR?

The XOR function outputs 1 only when exactly one of its inputs is 1:
- Input (0,0) → Output: 0
- Input (0,1) → Output: 1
- Input (1,0) → Output: 1
- Input (1,1) → Output: 0

### Why Can't a Single Perceptron Solve XOR?

A Perceptron creates a single straight line (or hyperplane in higher dimensions) to separate its outputs. However, the XOR problem requires two separate lines to correctly classify all points.

As you can see, no single straight line can separate the points where output should be 1 (blue) from points where output should be 0 (red).

## The Solution: Multiple Layers

To solve the XOR problem, we need to combine multiple Perceptrons in layers. This is our first glimpse at why we need neural networks!

By using multiple Perceptrons, we can:
1. First create separate regions with individual Perceptrons
2. Then combine these regions to form more complex decision boundaries

## Key Takeaways

1. Single Perceptrons can only solve linearly separable problems
2. Many real-world problems (like XOR) are not linearly separable
3. Combining Perceptrons into networks overcomes this limitation
4. This limitation led to the development of multi-layer neural networks

In the next section, we'll explore how to build and train these more powerful multi-layer networks.
