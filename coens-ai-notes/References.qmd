- [Journalists on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/JournalistsonHF/ai-toolkit)

Perplexity is often a great start for finding things (with references): https://www.perplexity.ai/
To understand about Transformers this is a very nice start: https://ig.ft.com/generative-ai/
'Our own' page about (Gen)AI: https://stasemsoft.github.io/FontysICT-sem1/docs/artificial-intelligence/ai.html
To dive further into how Transformers works: https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/how-transformer-llms-work/
and also to other short courses on deeplearning.ai
The development I showed was https://www.cursor.com/
you have like only 500 requests for free...  after that you could choose to pay 20 euro a Month (yes, that can be a lot for students, I know), or look for alternatives, 2 of which I tried a bit (you can use local LLM's with them, which basically makes them free): 
AIDER: https://aider.chat/.   
Avante: https://github.com/yetone/avante.nvim   (but then you need to learn about 'vi': https://neovim.io/ which is a  hurdle).
