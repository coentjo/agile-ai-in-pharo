Is it AI? Is it ai plane? No, but if you wanna do whatever in ICT then it's good to know and use markdown! 

**Why should I use Markdown?**

1. **Easy to read**: Markdown makes your text look nice and pretty. 
2. **Easy to type**: The pdf you are reading, for example, is written in markdown. 
3. **Works everywhere**: Markdown works on many websites, apps, and computers.
4. **difference**: showing the difference between two versions of a document (for example after editing) can be shown with every DIFF-tool. 

**Basic Markdown Rules**

1. **Headers**: Write `# Heading` for a big heading
2. **Bold text**: Surround with double asterisks: `**Text**`
3. **Italics**: Surround with single asterisks: `*Text*`
4. **Links**: Write `[Link text](http://www.example.com)`
Here are some basic Markdown syntax examples:

* Headers: `# Heading` or `## Subheading`
* Bold text: `**Bold text**`
* Italic text: `*Italic text*`
* Lists: `- Item 1`, `- Item 2`, etc.
* Links: `[Link text](http://www.example.com)`
* Images: `[Image alt text](http://www.example.com/image.jpg)`

Now that you know the basics of Markdown, give it a try and experiment with different formatting options!



If you are new to markdown, for example because you still use a text-editor like ms-word, we suggest start with installing [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), then maybe look at an introduction like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ft9G6JUfO0), or [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3e7GWsqoU0), or [the least scary Obsidian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ccktMJ1YHI).
