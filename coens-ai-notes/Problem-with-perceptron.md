So the Perceptron was able to learn to classify on which side of a straight line dots were, only by training it with a lot of points and telling them which side of the line they should be.
Looking back at a different example: a Perceptron as a AND and OR port:

Wait!? This picture also shows a straight line!

Instead of 2 colors we see 2 different values (T and F).

Only 1 Perceptron can not act as an XOR-Gate. For that we need to create a network of Perceptrons.
As you may imagine a lot of 'contexts' are more complex than linear.
