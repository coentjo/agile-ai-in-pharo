title: "Beyond the Prompt: The Power of AI Context"
---

A simple prompt is just a question. But to get truly powerful results from an AI, you need to master the art of providing **context**. This chapter, inspired by best practices from tools like [Cursor](https://cursor.com/learn/context), reframes this crucial skill for everyone, not just programmers.


**What is Context?**

Think of context as a **briefing you give to a human assistant**. The better the briefing, the better the result. You wouldn't just tell an assistant "write a report" without giving them the source material. The same is true for AI.

Context is all the relevant information you provide *along with* your prompt. This can include:

-   **Pasting in text:** Providing the specific email you want to reply to, or the article you want summarized.
-   **Setting the scene:** Telling the AI who it is ("You are a friendly, expert marketer") and who you are ("I am a beginner learning about this topic").
-   **Providing examples:** Giving it a sample of the writing style you want it to adopt.
-   **Referencing the conversation:** Using the information discussed earlier in your chat.

Without context, the AI has to guess. And when it guesses, you get generic, boring, and often unhelpful answers.
