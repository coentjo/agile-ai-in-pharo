## Making Decisions

A Perceptron can be used to make decisions based on multiple inputs. Let's look at a practical example, where we take a perceptron with weights $0.5$ and $-0.8$ 
and bias $0.3$

This Perceptron takes two inputs and makes a decision based on their values. The weights and bias determine how the Perceptron interprets the inputs.

For example, if we have inputs `x1 = 1` and `x2 = 0.5`, the Perceptron will:
1. Calculate the weighted sum: $0.5 \cdot 1 + (-0.8) \cdot 0.5 = 0.1$
2. Add the bias: $0.1 + 0.3 = 0.4$
3. Apply the step function: since $0.4 > 0$, output will be 1

This means the Perceptron has decided "yes" for these input values.

## Understanding the Decision Boundary

The weights and bias create a decision boundary in the input space. Any point above this boundary will result in an output of 1, while points below will result in 0.

For our example:
- Weight 1 (0.5) determines how much we value the first input
- Weight 2 (-0.8) determines how much we value the second input
- The bias (0.3) shifts the decision boundary

This creates a line where:
$0.5x_1 - 0.8x_2 + 0.3 = 0$

Points above this line will result in a "yes" decision, while points below will result in a "no" decision.

## Applications

This decision-making capability can be used for:

- Classification problems
- Pattern recognition
- Simple rule-based systems
- Binary decisions based on multiple factors

The beauty of this approach is that by adjusting the weights and bias, we can create different decision boundaries for different types of problems.
