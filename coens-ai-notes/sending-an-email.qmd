## Scenario: Replying to an Email

Let's see context in action.

**Bad Prompt (No Context)**

> "Draft a polite and professional email saying I can't make it."

The AI will produce a generic, fill-in-the-blanks template. It's not very helpful because it lacks any specific details.


**Good Prompt (With Context)**
> "I need to reply to this email. **[Paste the full text of the original email here]**. Please draft a polite and professional reply explaining that I can't make the 'Project Phoenix' meeting on Wednesday because of a conflict, but I am very interested. Ask if they can send me the minutes and suggest I'm available to connect next week."

See the difference? By providing the original email and clear instructions, you've given the AI all the context it needs to draft a perfect, ready-to-send reply.

**The "Context Window": An AI's Short-Term Memory**

It's important to know that every AI has a limited memory, called a **"context window."** This is the maximum amount of information (your prompt, the text you've pasted, the conversation history) that the model can "see" at one time.

If your conversation gets very long, the AI might start to "forget" things you discussed at the beginning. If you notice the AI losing track, it might be time to start a new conversation to give it a fresh, clean context to work with.
