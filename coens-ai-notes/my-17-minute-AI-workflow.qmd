- The video proposes a 3-step AI workflow (using Elicit, NotebookLM, and Claude) to improve knowledge work by focusing on finding and leveraging high-quality academic inputs, rather than relying on generic web search or LLM outputs.[1]
- Elicit is used to discover and access scholarly papers; NotebookLM summarizes and extracts actionable frameworks from these, and Claude turns insights into practical, leadership-oriented plans for the workplace.[1]
- The key message is that “improving your input” with robust sources and critical thinking—rather than just automating output—will give you a significant edge in the AI-powered workplace of 2025.[1]
